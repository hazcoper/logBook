add gpredict data as well
    want to know the elev and az that gqrx wanted
    make sure i know where the antena was pointing and where it was suppoed to be pointing
    need to check to see if this data is not what rotctl tells me already with primesat

solve gqrx communication
    can i use it while using gpredict radio corrections?
    start recording raw file
    use over the network

cut raw file automatically after recording
    add the ability to pass in raw file name and metadata name and it cuts

countdown counters should go to negative

long beacon should be a beacon as well
    register on the timeline normal beacon prediction
    and reset the normal beacon counter as well

dump metadata if application is closed with unsaved metadata

gqrx and rotctl all inherit from a parent class

add config
    folders, ip, ports...
    
fixed discrepancies with time
    start time and event time have different formats
    define better how they are handled in the code
